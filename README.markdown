This is an example `CWEB` program I did back in 2002. It is a moderately interesting literate programming example.

I happened to futz with this on OS X, and you're going to need some amount of `CWEB` tools, most notably `ctangle` and `cweave`. I also happen to like making PDFs myself (instead of DVIs), so I use `pdftex` (instead of `tex`) too.

By default, it makes a program called `sha256` which will run some unit tests.
